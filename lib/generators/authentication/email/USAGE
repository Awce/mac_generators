Description:
    Generates files for email/password authentication, based on Rails
    has_secure_password functionality.
    It uses warden with a single database authentication strategy.

    By default without parameters all code will be generated for a model Identity
    which will be used for authetication purposes.

    If you want to generate authentication for another model than Identity then
    pass it as a first parameter.

    Also if you want signup and signin templates to be haml files pass the option
    --haml, otherwise they will be erb.

Example:
    rails generate authentication:email

    This will create:
        app/controllers/identities_controller.rb
        app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb
        app/views/identities/new.html.erb
        app/views/sessions/new.html.erb
        app/models/identity.rb
        config/initializers/warden.rb
        lib/strategies/database_authentication.rb

    And will modify:
        app/controllers/application_controller.rb
        config/locales/en.yml

    And will add the following routes:
        route  get 'sign_up' => 'identities#new', as: :sign_up
        route  get 'log_in' => 'sessions#new', as: :log_in
        route  get 'log_out' => 'sessions#destroy', as: :log_out
        route  resource :identity, only: [:create, :new]
        route  resource :sessions, only: [:create, :new]

    And finally will add to Gemfile:
        warden (~> 1.2.0)
